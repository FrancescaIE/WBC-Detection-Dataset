DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
------------------------------
File List: 

The total number of images in the dataset is 655 composed of 655 annotated images and their corresponding YOLO Darknet TXT files. 
The images have been split into training, validation, and testing folder with a 70:15:15 ratio.   

“test” folder contains two subfolders "images" and "labels" containing the 98 annotated images and their respective TXT files. 

“valid” folder contains two subfolders "images" and "labels" containing the 98 annotated images and their respective TXT files. 

“train” folder contains two subfolders "images" and "labels" containing the 459 annotated images and their respective TXT files.

ABSTRACT
------------------------------
This dataset was prepared in part of employing YOLOv5 for white blood cell image detection and counting of juvenile Visayan Warty pigs. This dataset is 
important in supplying material for exploring the application of machine learning for veterinary use.
